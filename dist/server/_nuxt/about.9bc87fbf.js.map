I am specialised in Web Development and Software tools to support DevX. I am passionate about coding64nd designing tech solutions for live problems.\n        </SectionParagraph>\n        <SectionParagraph>\n          I'm currently working full time as CTO for <LinkBtn link=\"https://www.moank.se/\" text=\"Moank AB\"/>, a cool heavy tech oriented bank based in Stockholm. I got \"adobted\" by the founders of the company in mid 2018 after graduating. The company was still at a Startup phase and I've been working on the development of the bank's core system since I was a Junior Developer.\n        </SectionParagraph>\n        <SectionParagraph>\n          During this career opportunity I had the chance to mature to my current position passing through the roles of Senior Developer and Engineer Project Manager. I refined my skills in the stack used by the company: React, NodeJS, Typescript, MongoDB, AWS Cloud and Docker. I also had the chance to work with Python and Falcon for some internal tools.\n        </SectionParagraph>\n        <SectionParagraph>\n          Given the small size of the company, I often had to wear multiple hats. I had the chance to work on the DevOps side, setting up the CI/CD pipelines and the infrastructure on AWS. I also worked with the Product team, helping panning the roadmap and the features for the projects. I became the tech reference for the company with the opportunity to mentor and lead the other developers in the team and support the meetings with external partners.\n        </SectionParagraph>\n        <SectionParagraph>\n          I started learning about web development in my early high school years, where I was introduced to small webpages with simple HTML, CSS and JS. After my high-school, I took the univeristy path to increase my skills in this fascinating IT world and I graduated in Computer Science at the University of Genoa, Italy. During my university years I had the chance to work on some small projects and I started to learn about the backend side of the web with PHP, C#, Java and MySQL. I also started to learn about the Linux world and the terminal, which is now my daily driver.\n        </SectionParagraph>\n        <SectionParagraph>\n          You can find some of my experimental side projects on my <LinkBtn link=\"https://github.com/FabriSilve\" text=\"Github\"/> or on my <LinkBtn link=\"/\" text=\"Portfolio\"/> page. I usually don't update my portfolio page but all my recent one's are on github.\n        </SectionParagraph>\n        <SectionParagraph>\n          Outside of my work-life, I love to play Ukulele, doing Film Photography and Cooking.
