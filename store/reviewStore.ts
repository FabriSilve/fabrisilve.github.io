Nevertheless, his cheerful vibes, delightful desserts, and genuine care for the team make every workday a treat. Cheers to Fabrizio! üç™üòä",

            review: 'He is always really kind and positive to work with. Funny, and tries to bring light to a dark situation. He is really supporting of this team and tries to make sure you actually understand what you are working on. He wants the entire time to shine, and he is a really good teamplayer (But this was no surprise). What surprised me (and what I have seen him improve) is how he is not afraid to question if there is a decision which he disagrees with, and to say no if there is something he wont have time for.',
